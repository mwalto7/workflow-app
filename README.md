# Workflow

## Getting started:
1. Open two terminals and run `yarn start` in one and `yarn run server` in the other.
2. These routes are available:
  * `http://localhost:3000/` [Home page]
  * `http://localhost:3000/register` [Registration form]
  * `http://localhost:3000/login` [Login form]
  * `http://localhost:8081/graphiql` [Graphiql endpoint]

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).
